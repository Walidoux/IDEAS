### Creating a script language for Habbo Retro development:

- [ ] Basics of the language: (Syntax/Grammar) 
  - [ ] Define the keywords, operators, and syntax of the language.
  - [ ] Come up with a grammar that specifies how the language elements can be combined to form valid and logic code
  - [ ] Write a Lexer to tokenize the input program into a stream of tokens that the parser can use.

- [ ] Implementing a parser:
  - [ ] Write a parser that reads the token stream produced by the lexer
  - [ ] Generate an AST that represents the structure of the program.
  - [ ] Use a parsing technique such as LL(k) or LR(k) to handle the grammar of the language.
